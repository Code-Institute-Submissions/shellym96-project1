## Code Validation


### HTML

I have used the recommended [HTML W3C Validator](https://validator.w3.org) to validate all of my HTML files.


| Page | W3C URL | Screenshot | Notes |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Home | [W3C](https://validator.w3.org/nu/?doc=https%3A%2F%2Fshellym96.github.io%2Fproject1%2Findex.html) | ![screenshot](assets/documentation/html-validation.png) | Pass - no errors or warnings to show|

### CSS

I have used the recommended [CSS Jigsaw Validator](https://jigsaw.w3.org/css-validator) to validate all of my CSS files.

## Browser Compatibility

I've tested my deployed project on multiple browsers to check for compatibility issues.
Everything remained the same, the way it was intended.

## Lighthouse Audit

I've tested my deployed project using the Lighthouse Audit tool to check for any major issues.

### GitHub **Issues**


**Fixed Bugs**

All previously closed/fixed bugs can be tracked [here](https://github.com/shellym96/project1/issues?q=is%3Aissue+is%3Aclosed).

| Bug | Status |
| --- | --- |
| Social media icons wouldn't seperate as I had intended, tried different code to fix the problem. Doubled checked to see spelling was wrong on the class.| Closed |
| Occasion images would not go to size and when changed they would go vertical. When I found a way to make them horizontal they would have no space. Tried margin and padding, with no luck. Found grid to fix issue. | Closed |
| W3C, had testing issues. Errors of duplicate attributes, unclosed a attributes with extra closing div. All resolved. | Closed |


There are no remaining bugs that I am aware of.
