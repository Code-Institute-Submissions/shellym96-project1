# Blossoming Bl치thanna

Blossoming Bl치thanna is an irish owned florist based in the capital city of Ireland, Dublin. Proud to be an Irish grown business , we have our native language in the name. Bl치thanna meaning flowers in Irish. With our aim to bring a complete online flower service to customers with the option of having a flower subscription to have flowers delivered to you or a loved one on a date you choose, continuously. This being a website the customer can view images of bouquets, customers favourites and even add on some extras to go with their flowers if needs be. Contact can be made by emailing, calling or simply by signing up to our subscription page.

Here's my deployed site as an example:

## UX

This website was thought of to be colorful and visually appealing to the customer. Spacious enough that it isn't overwhelming for the viewer, but isn't too plain to loose interest. 

While being easy to navigate for any age or device you are on. The hover effect over the titles and images, then having links added to some images and text for other pages of the website , making it easier again for the customer to access parts of the website without having to go out of their way too look for what they need.

### Colour Scheme
I decided to go with these colours , to have a fun, light side to the website , all while having a mature feel with the dark brown writing. Nothing too gloomy as for a florist website it should be colourful, which is why I went with a dark brown instead of your typical black.

- `#512E10` used for primary text.
- `#C6A381` used for primary background highlights of text.
- `#FFF1F5` used for background colour.
- `#FADADD` used for highlights of header and subscription form.


I used Coolers ' https://coolors.co/fff1f5-fadadd-f5d6b0-c6a381-512e10 ' to generate my colour palette.

### Typography

I used fontpair to find the perfect font for my website, and I chose the font named Forum. As it has a classic roman times look.

I then used fontawesome for my icons. As I just have icons in the footer for social media.

- [Forum](https://www.fontpair.co/fonts/forum) was used for the entirety of the text.


- [Font Awesome](https://fontawesome.com) icons were used throughout the site, such as the social media icons in the footer.

## Wireframes

To follow best practice, wireframes were developed for mobile, tablet, and desktop sizes.
I've used [Balsamiq](https://balsamiq.com/wireframes) to design my site wireframes.

## Features
